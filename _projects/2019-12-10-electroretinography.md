The recording of electrophysiological signals from eyes known as electroretinography (ERG) should be understood as a foundational technique in visual ecology. The physiological qualities it can assess such as such as spectral sensitivity and temporal acuity influence everything in an animal's ecology from mate choice to movement speed. But when I was hired to build the Speiser lab ERG system, I found that existing ERG techniques were mostly time- and labor-intensive and required expertise beyond that necessary for a good electrophysiological preparation.

Instead of recapitulating existing systems, I built an automated ERG system capable of presenting stimuli at a high degree of accuracy to both wavelength and photon number while recording from an eye and notating the recording. To increase efficiency further, I developed a new formula for normalizing eye responses that was able to capture equivalent information to methods of sensitivity conversion requiring many more steps of data collection. In the end, we were able to develop a technique that accurately assessed spectral sensitivity in 8 min, 30 sec.

Our techniques and system are currently under review, and this post will be updated once they are published. Check back soon for the paper as well as a link to the open source software I wrote for running your own automated ERG system.
