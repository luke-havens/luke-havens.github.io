Since joining the Lohmann lab, I've worked developing tools to study a black box. My research is focused on understanding how animals process the Earth’s magnetic field, and because no receptor has been identified for this sense (despite strong behavioral evidence in a wide variety of animals), it’s difficult to study processing. Put simply, how can you study how information is processed if you don’t know what information is being encoded? My work tries to answer this and other fundamental questions about the magnetic sense in the Caribbean spiny lobster, *Panulirus argus*.

My research takes an integrative approach, using behavior to ground-truth explanatory biological neural network models. Essentially, I build neural models connected to models of proposed magnetic sensors and ask two questions: **1. How well do these models perform at navigation?** and **2. Do the models “break down” in the same way as actual spiny lobsters’ behavior?** By comparing the performance of my models to behavioral data from spiny lobster, I develop testable hypotheses as to how the magnetic field may be processed in *P. argus*. Finally, I am developing further behavioral tests to determine which of my models is most likely and from this identifying potential *P. argus* brain regions that process the magnetic field for electrophysiological work.
