## About Me

I’m a queer Southerner who came to neuroethology by way of a stint working as a baker and a professor who figured that if I could turn out consistent baked goods on a regular basis, I’d probably make a good bench scientist. After taking his neurobiology course, he hired me as his TA to teach future students how to record from neurons, build bio-inspired robots, and design independent research projects. I eventually parlayed this experience teaching electrophysiology into a position designing equipment for electrophysiology, and I spent the next two years designing and building an automated electroretinography system for [Dan Speiser’s visual ecology lab](https://www.speiserlab.com/). Learning to speak machine helped hone my questions about non-silico processing, and I joined Ken Lohmann’s lab at UNC to study how the Caribbean spiny lobster processes Earth’s magnetic field in Fall 2018. Since then, I’ve developed computational models for sensing & processing the magnetic field that explain observed lobster orientation behavior. Currently, these are being used to develop diagnostic behavioral tests and bioinspired robotics.

At UNC, I also work with the [graduate student-led DEI group](https://www.speiserlab.com/). My own background, experience teaching a highly technical electrophysiology lab, and copious amounts of data all support our conviction that rigorous intellectual work requires contributions from a diversity of perspectives and that academia benefits from increased accessibility. If you’re having difficulty navigating what can sometimes be a confusing and unfriendly system, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
