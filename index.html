  <h1 class="post-title">{{ "INTEGRATIVE SENSORY NEUROETHOLOGY" }}</h1>
  <h2>My work takes an integrative approach to sensory neuroethology, combining
    electrophysiology, behavior, computational modeling, and the occasional robot
     to answer one central question: how do animals transform our noisy world into
     the meaningful signals that allow them to survive?
